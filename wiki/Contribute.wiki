  * Automated performance tests. This would allow us to determine which configurations of Abot work best/worst in several different scenarios.
  * Free dedicated or virtual dedicated hardware (mostly Windows) for the build server, deployment hub, distributed crawl testing, etc..
  * Contributors familiar with the mono environment to get/keep Abot running well on mono

==Always Need==
  * Donations (See section below)
  * Spread the word on blogs/websites and tell others why Abot is great

  * Contribute to [http://code.google.com/p/abot-contrib/ Abot-Contrib]
  * Let us know when you create a cool project that uses Abot so we know
