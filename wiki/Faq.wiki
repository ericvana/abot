*Why did you create Abot?*<br />
A project that I was working on a few years ago needed to have its proprietary web crawler completely redone due to stability/performance/maintenance issues. There were no open source C# .Net web crawlers available. 

We purchased a license to the leading 3rd party crawler and I spent several months forcefully bending it to do what we needed it to do. The process made me take note of all the pains that I had along the way. Abot was built to be exactly what I needed back then. 

*Can the crawl be distributed over multiple machines (distributed crawling)?*<br /> 
Yes, just implement the IScheduler interface to suite your distributed needs and pass it into the WebCrawler constructor.
